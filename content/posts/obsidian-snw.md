Now in Obsidian, you can see how many links any backlink has, using a new 
plugin named 'Strange New Worlds' by TfT Hacker (who's also the man behind 
[BRAT plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) and [Text 
Transporter](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-text-transporter)). 

By using Strange New Worlds plugin you could add more backlinks in your 
notes 'on the fly', while editing them, and get more insights.

Roam, and Logseq users are familiar with such feature, but Obsidian users 
may not, so take a look at this screenshot:

Plugin adds those little rectangles over the right corner of backlinks in 
your text. When you hover your mouse cursor over it, you'll get such a 
popup, and you will see notes that are linked to this backlinked one. 

You can install this plugin as usual: press Settings button (or CMD + ,), 
navigate to Community Plugins tab, then hit 'Browse' button and search for 
'Strange New Worlds' plugin there, then press 'Install' and 'Enable' 
buttons. 

Happy backlinking!
